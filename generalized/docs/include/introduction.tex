\section{Introduction}

In three-dimensional space, orthogonal vectors are perpendicular to each other, meaning their dot product equals zero. This document describes a flexible Python tool for generating and visualizing vectors that are orthogonal to the x=y=z line (the (1,1,1) direction) in three-dimensional space, with advanced plotting capabilities.

\subsection{Project Overview}

The Orthogonal Vector Visualization System is a Python tool that generates vectors orthogonal to the x=y=z line using a basis vector approach. It provides comprehensive visualization options for both single and multiple vectors, supporting various projection methods, parameter ranges, and visualization styles. The system uses two basis vectors [1, -1/2, -1/2] and [0, -1/2, 1/2] that span the plane orthogonal to the (1,1,1) direction.

\subsection{Key Features}

The implementation offers the following key features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Single R Vector Generation}: Generates a single R vector orthogonal to the x=y=z line using basis vectors.
    
    \item \textbf{Multiple Vector Generation}: Supports generating multiple vectors with parameter ranges for distance and angle.
    
    \item \textbf{Perfect Orthogonal Circle Generation}: Implements a specialized method for generating perfect circles in the plane orthogonal to the x=y=z line, ensuring all points are exactly at the specified distance from the origin and perfectly orthogonal to the (1,1,1) direction.
    
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Visualization}: Supports 3D visualization with color-coded axes, coordinate labels, and data-driven scaling, as well as 2D projections and endpoints-only plotting.
    
    \item \textbf{Configurable Parameters}: All aspects of vector generation and visualization can be configured through command-line arguments or configuration files.
    
    \item \textbf{Command-line Interface}: A comprehensive command-line interface with extensive options.
    
    \item \textbf{Configuration File Support}: Configurations can be saved to and loaded from JSON files.
    
    \item \textbf{Circle/Sphere Pattern Generation}: Includes examples for generating circle and sphere-like patterns.
\end{itemize}
