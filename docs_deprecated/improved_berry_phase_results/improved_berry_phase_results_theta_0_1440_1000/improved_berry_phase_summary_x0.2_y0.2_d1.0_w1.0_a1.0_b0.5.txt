Winding Number Analysis for Eigenstate 2:
--------------------------------------------------
Eigenstate 2 shows an interesting behavior where the raw Berry phase is 0.000000 radians with a
normalized phase of 0.000000 radians. This corresponds to a winding number
of 0.0, which is consistent with the theoretical expectation.

The high number of parity flips (12) for eigenstate 2 supports this
interpretation, indicating that this state undergoes significant phase changes during the cycle.

Eigenvalue Normalization:
  Global Minimum: 0.581776
  Global Maximum: 2.107665
  Global Range: 1.525889
  Normalization Formula: normalized = (original - 0.581776) / 1.525889

  Note: All eigenstate plots and degeneracy analyses use normalized (0-1 range) values.
