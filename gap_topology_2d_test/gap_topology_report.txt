Gap-Topology Correlation Analysis:
  Detailed correlation analysis for 2D scans is not implemented.
  Please refer to the 2D heatmaps for visual correlation analysis.

General Observations:
  The relationship between energy gaps and Berry phases provides insight into the topological properties of the system.
  Small energy gaps often coincide with rapid changes in Berry phase, indicating potential topological transitions.
  Regions with both small gaps and large Berry phase differences are of particular interest for further study.
