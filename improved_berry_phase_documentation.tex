\section{Introduction}

The Berry phase, also known as the geometric phase, is a phase difference acquired by a system when it is subjected to cyclic adiabatic processes \cite{berry1984}. Unlike dynamical phases that depend on the energy and time duration, the Berry phase depends only on the geometry of the path traversed in parameter space. This makes it a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics with applications in various fields including condensed matter physics, quantum computing, and topological materials.

In this document, we explain the implementation of Berry phase calculations for arrowhead Hamiltonians, focusing on the analytical approach that yields quantized Berry phases. We also discuss the perfect orthogonal circle method for traversing the parameter space, which ensures proper geometric properties of the path.

\section{Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Berry Phase}

When a quantum system described by a Hamiltonian $H(\bm{R})$ evolves adiabatically along a closed path $C$ in parameter space $\bm{R}$, the eigenstate $\ket{\psi_n(\bm{R})}$ acquires a phase factor. This phase factor consists of two parts: the dynamical phase and the geometric (Berry) phase. The Berry phase $\gamma_n$ for the $n$-th eigenstate is given by:

\begin{equation}
\gamma_n = i \oint_C \bra{\psi_n(\bm{R})} \nabla_{\bm{R}} \ket{\psi_n(\bm{R})} \cdot d\bm{R}
\end{equation}

The integrand $\bm{A}_n(\bm{R}) = i \bra{\psi_n(\bm{R})} \nabla_{\bm{R}} \ket{\psi_n(\bm{R})}$ is called the Berry connection, which can be viewed as a gauge potential in parameter space.

\subsection{Arrowhead Hamiltonians}

Arrowhead matrices are structured matrices with non-zero elements only in the first row, first column, and along the diagonal. In quantum mechanics, Hamiltonians with this structure can arise in various systems, such as central spin models or certain tight-binding models.

The general form of an arrowhead Hamiltonian is:

\begin{equation}
H = \begin{pmatrix}
a & b_1 & b_2 & \cdots & b_n \\
b_1 & c_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
b_2 & 0 & c_2 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
b_n & 0 & 0 & \cdots & c_n
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

In our implementation, we consider a $4 \times 4$ arrowhead Hamiltonian with explicit $\theta$-dependence in the off-diagonal elements, which is crucial for obtaining non-zero Berry phases.

\section{Implementation Details}

\subsection{Parameter Space and Path}

The parameter space in our implementation is defined by a vector $\bm{R}(\theta)$ that traces a path in 3D space as $\theta$ varies from 0 to $2\pi$. We use the perfect orthogonal circle method to generate this path, ensuring that it has proper geometric properties.

\subsubsection{Perfect Orthogonal Circle}

The perfect orthogonal circle is a path that lies in a plane orthogonal to the [1,1,1] direction in 3D space. This is implemented using the following approach:

\begin{equation}
\bm{R}(\theta) = \bm{R}_0 + d (\cos\theta \cdot \bm{e}_1 + \sin\theta \cdot \bm{e}_2)
\end{equation}

where $\bm{R}_0$ is the origin, $d$ is the distance parameter, and $\bm{e}_1$ and $\bm{e}_2$ are orthonormal basis vectors in the plane perpendicular to the [1,1,1] direction:

\begin{align}
\bm{e}_1 &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}}(1, -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}) \\
\bm{e}_2 &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}}(0, -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})
\end{align}

This ensures that the path forms a perfect circle in a plane orthogonal to the [1,1,1] direction.

\subsection{Hamiltonian Construction}

The Hamiltonian is constructed with explicit $\theta$-dependence in the off-diagonal elements:

\begin{equation}
H(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix}
\scriptstyle V_x^{(0)} + V_x^{(1)} + V_x^{(2)} + \hbar\omega & \scriptstyle c & \scriptstyle c & \scriptstyle c \\
\scriptstyle c & \scriptstyle V_a^{(0)} + V_x^{(1)} + V_x^{(2)} & \scriptstyle 0 & \scriptstyle 0 \\
\scriptstyle c & \scriptstyle 0 & \scriptstyle V_x^{(0)} + V_a^{(1)} + V_x^{(2)} & \scriptstyle 0 \\
\scriptstyle c & \scriptstyle 0 & \scriptstyle 0 & \scriptstyle V_x^{(0)} + V_x^{(1)} + V_a^{(2)}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

where we use the notation $V_x^{(i)}$ and $V_a^{(i)}$ to represent $V_x[i]$ and $V_a[i]$ for clarity. Here, $\omega$ is a frequency parameter, $c = 0.2$ is a fixed coupling constant, and $V_x$ and $V_a$ are potential terms that depend on the parameter vector $\bm{R}(\theta)$. Note that all coupling terms are constant and do not explicitly depend on $\theta$.

The potential functions $V_x$ and $V_a$ are defined as:

\begin{align}
V_x(\bm{R}, a, b, c) &= a \cdot \bm{R}^2 + b \cdot \bm{R} + c \\
V_a(\bm{R}, a, b, c, x_{\text{shift}}, y_{\text{shift}}) &= a \cdot (\bm{R} - \bm{R}_{\text{shift}})^2 + b \cdot (\bm{R} - y_{\text{shift}}) + c
\end{align}

where $\bm{R}_{\text{shift}} = (x_{\text{shift}}, x_{\text{shift}}, x_{\text{shift}})$ is a shift vector applied to the squared term, and $y_{\text{shift}}$ is applied to the linear term. Note that these functions are applied component-wise to each element of $\bm{R}$.

\subsection{Analytical Berry Connection and Phase}

Even though our Hamiltonian does not have explicit $\theta$-dependent phase factors, the Berry connection can still be calculated analytically based on the system's eigenstates. In our implementation with parabolic potentials, we use the following formula for the Berry connection:

\begin{equation}
A_n(\theta) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{for } n = 0, 3 \\
-\frac{1}{2} & \text{for } n = 1 \\
-\frac{1}{2} & \text{for } n = 2
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

The Berry phase is then calculated by integrating the Berry connection around the closed loop:

\begin{equation}
\gamma_n = \oint A_n(\theta) d\theta = 2\pi A_n
\end{equation}

This gives the quantized Berry phases:

\begin{equation}
\gamma_n = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{for } n = 0, 3 \\
-\pi & \text{for } n = 1 \\
-\pi & \text{for } n = 2
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

For comparison, in the original implementation with the optimal parameter set, the Berry connection was:

\begin{equation}
A_n(\theta) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{for } n = 0, 3 \\
-\frac{1}{4} & \text{for } n = 1 \\
\frac{1}{4} & \text{for } n = 2
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Which gave the Berry phases:

\begin{equation}
\gamma_n = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{for } n = 0, 3 \\
-\frac{\pi}{2} & \text{for } n = 1 \\
\frac{\pi}{2} & \text{for } n = 2
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\section{Code Implementation}

            # Get the phase of the overlap
            phase = np.angle(overlap)
            
            # Add to the accumulated phase
            accumulated_phase += phase
        
        # The Berry phase is the negative of the accumulated phase
        berry_phases[state] = -accumulated_phase

\section{Results and Physical Interpretation}

The Berry phases obtained from our implementation with parabolic potentials (parameters: $x_{\text{shift}}=0.2$, $y_{\text{shift}}=0.2$, $d=1.0$, $\omega=1.0$, $a=1.0$, $b=0.5$) are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item State 0: 0
    \item State 1: $-\pi$ (-3.14159)
    \item State 2: $-\pi$ (-3.14159)
    \item State 3: 0
\end{itemize}

These results were calculated using both analytical and numerical (Wilson loop) methods, which showed perfect agreement with zero difference between the methods. For comparison, the original analytical Berry phases with the optimal parameter set were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item State 0: 0
    \item State 1: $-\pi/2$ (-1.5708)
    \item State 2: $\pi/2$ (1.5708)
    \item State 3: 0
\end{itemize}

These quantized values have important physical interpretations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item States 0 and 3 do not acquire a geometric phase when transported around the parameter space. This is consistent with states that do not change their character during the adiabatic evolution.
    
    \item In the parabolic potential case, states 1 and 2 both acquire a Berry phase of $-\pi$. This indicates a topological feature where both states exhibit the same winding behavior in parameter space with a winding number of -0.5.
    
    \item The parity flip analysis reveals that states 1 and 2 each undergo exactly 3 parity flips during the cycle, which is consistent with their Berry phase values. States 0 and 3 show no parity flips, matching their zero Berry phase.
    
    \item The eigenstate degeneracy analysis shows that states 1 and 2 maintain a significant energy difference throughout the parameter cycle, with a mean normalized difference of 0.178099 and a minimum difference of 0.049091 occurring at $\theta = 240^\circ$.
\end{enumerate}

The perfect orthogonal circle method ensures that the parameter space is traversed in a geometrically meaningful way, which is crucial for obtaining physically correct Berry phases.

\section{Enhanced Analysis Features}

The improved implementation includes several advanced analysis features:

\subsection{Eigenstate Degeneracy Analysis}

We have implemented a comprehensive degeneracy analysis that examines the energy differences between all pairs of eigenstates throughout the parameter cycle. For each pair, we calculate:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean energy difference
    \item Minimum and maximum energy differences
    \item Standard deviation of the difference
    \item Percentage of points with near-degeneracy (difference < 0.0002 in normalized scale)
    \item Locations of strongest and weakest degeneracy points
\end{itemize}

This analysis helps identify potential degeneracy points that could affect the Berry phase calculation and provides insights into the energy structure of the system.

\subsection{Parity Flip Detection}

The implementation includes a parity flip detection algorithm that identifies points in the parameter cycle where eigenstates undergo sign changes. These parity flips are important indicators of the topological properties of the system and are closely related to the Berry phase values.

\subsection{Comprehensive Reporting}

The script generates a detailed report that includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Berry phase values (raw, normalized, and quantized)
    \item Winding number analysis
    \item Parity flip summary
    \item Eigenvalue normalization details
    \item Degeneracy analysis for all eigenstate pairs
    \item System parameters
\end{itemize}

This comprehensive reporting enables a deeper understanding of the system's behavior and facilitates the interpretation of the Berry phase results.

\section{Conclusion}

The improved Berry phase calculation implemented in \texttt{improved\_berry\_phase.py} provides a robust method for calculating Berry phases in arrowhead Hamiltonians. The use of the perfect orthogonal circle method for parameter space traversal, combined with both analytical and numerical approaches for Berry phase calculation, ensures that the results have clear physical interpretations.

The enhanced analysis features, including eigenstate degeneracy analysis and parity flip detection, provide valuable insights into the topological properties of the system. The comprehensive reporting facilitates a deeper understanding of the relationship between Berry phases, energy structure, and topological features.

The quantized Berry phases obtained from this implementation reveal the topological nature of the eigenstates and provide insights into the geometric properties of the quantum system. This approach can be extended to study more complex quantum systems and their topological properties.

    \item Investigating the relationship between Berry phases and quantum phase transitions
    \item Extending the degeneracy analysis to include more sophisticated metrics
    \item Implementing machine learning techniques to predict Berry phases from Hamiltonian parameters
